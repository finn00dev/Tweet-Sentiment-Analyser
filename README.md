# Tweet-Sentiment-Analyser

This is a simple console application made with Python. The application provides a summary of the most recent tweets posted by any given
user and their calculated sentiment values. It uses the Twitter API and a set of positive/negative keywords (provided from http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html) to analyse the sentiment of any user's recent tweets by counting the given keywords.

NOTE: This github repository does not come with the required Twitter API Access Keys/Secrets, you must replace the placeholder values with your own codes.
